    ## Summary
    Implement comprehensive portfolio aggregation functionality with 5 core functions,
    29 unit tests, and <1 second performance for 10,000 positions. All functions use
    pre-calculated values from Section 1.4.1 and integrate Greeks from Section 1.4.2.
    
    ## Core Functions Implemented
    • calculate_portfolio_exposures() - Gross/net/long/short exposure metrics

    • aggregate_by_tags() - Strategy-based position grouping with OR/AND logic
    • aggregate_by_underlying() - Critical for options risk analysis
    
    ## Key Features
    • Performance: Pandas-optimized vectorized operations, <1s for 10k positions
    • Precision: Decimal throughout calculations (2 places monetary, 4 places Greeks)
    • Caching: Custom timed_lru_cache with 60-second TTL
    • Error Handling: Graceful handling of missing data and malformed inputs

    • API Endpoints: JSON-compatible responses with proper precision
    • Database: Accepts pre-loaded data (no database queries in functions)
    • Caching: 60-second TTL with manual cache clearing utilities
    
    ## Documentation Updated
    • TODO.md: Section 1.4.3 marked complete with implementation notes
    • White Paper: Comprehensive section 1.4.3 with business applications
    • Implementation Checklist: All tasks completed with results documented

    feat: Complete Section 1.4.2 - Options Greeks Calculations with V1.4 Hybrid Engine
    
    Implements comprehensive options Greeks calculations with real/mock fallback approach
    using mibian library for Black-Scholes calculations. Includes full database integration,
    comprehensive testing, and documentation updates.
    
    ## Core Implementation
    
    ### New Files Added:
    - `app/calculations/greeks.py` - Core Greeks calculation engine
    - `tests/test_greeks_calculations.py` - Comprehensive unit tests (20/21 passing)
    - `tests/fixtures/greeks_fixtures.py` - Test fixtures for all position types
    - `scripts/test_greeks.py` - Manual testing script with real calculations
    
    ### Key Features:
    - **Hybrid Calculation Engine**: Real Greeks using mibian, mock fallback
    - **Database Integration**: Updates position_greeks table with upsert operations
    - **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, manual tests, performance tests
    - **Position Type Support**: All types (LC, SC, LP, SP, LONG, SHORT)
    - **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks with comprehensive logging
    - **Portfolio Aggregation**: Bulk updates and portfolio-level summaries
    
    ### Technical Implementation:
    - **Primary Library**: mibian v0.1.3 for Black-Scholes calculations
    - **Fallback Strategy**: PRD-specified mock values when real calculations fail
    - **Stock Positions**: Simple delta (±1.0), zero other Greeks
    - **Expired Options**: All Greeks return 0.0
    - **Performance**: <100ms per position, <5s for 100-position portfolio
    
    ## Library Change Decision
    
    ### Issue with py_vollib:
    - Originally planned to use py_vollib as primary library
    - py_vollib dependency py_lets_be_rational imports _testcapi
    - _testcapi is a private CPython testing module not available in standard installations
    - Causes ModuleNotFoundError on Python 3.11+
    
    ### Solution:
    - Switched to mibian library which provides equivalent Black-Scholes calculations
    - mibian works perfectly with Python 3.11+ and provides same mathematical results
    - Maintained py_vollib as fallback option in dependencies
    
    ## Documentation Updates
    
    ### PRD_V1.4.md:
    - Updated Position Greeks section to specify mibian as primary
    - Added implementation notes explaining py_vollib compatibility issues
    - Updated technology stack and dependency specifications
    - Added detailed explanation of _testcapi import problem
    
    ### TODO.md:
    - Marked Section 1.4.2 as COMPLETED (2025-07-16)
    - Added comprehensive implementation notes and technical details
    - Documented library change decision and rationale
    - Added test results and integration status
    
    ### pyproject.toml:
    - Reordered dependencies to prioritize mibian over py-vollib
    - Added comments explaining library roles and compatibility issues
    
    ## Test Results
    
    ### Unit Tests:
    - 20/21 tests passing (1 skipped for py_vollib unavailability)
    - Full coverage of all position types and edge cases
    - Performance tests for large portfolios
    - Database integration tests
    
    ### Manual Tests:
    - Real Greeks calculations working with mibian
    - Mock fallback scenarios tested
    - Expired options handling verified
    - Portfolio aggregation confirmed
    
    ## Integration Status
    
    - **Database**: Ready for position_greeks table updates
    - **Market Data**: Integrated with existing market_data_service
    - **Batch Processing**: Functions ready for daily batch jobs
    - **API Endpoints**: Ready for REST API exposure
    
    This completes the core calculation engine for Section 1.4.2 with production-ready
    implementation using mibian library for reliable Black-Scholes calculations.

    feat: Implement market data calculations with database integration (Section 1.4.1)
    
    ## Core Calculation Functions
    
    ### 1. calculate_position_market_value(position, current_price)
    - ✅ Market Value: Always positive using abs(quantity) × price × multiplier
    - ✅ Exposure: Signed value quantity × price × multiplier (negative for shorts)
    - ✅ Options Support: 100x multiplier for contracts (LC, LP, SC, SP)
    - ✅ Stock Support: 1x multiplier for stocks (LONG, SHORT)
    - ✅ Unrealized P&L: Current exposure - cost basis calculation
    
    ### 2. calculate_daily_pnl(db, position, current_price)
    - ✅ Database Integration: Automatically fetches previous price from market_data_cache
    - ✅ Fallback Logic: Uses position.last_price if no market data found
    - ✅ Error Handling: Returns zero P&L with error message if no previous price
    - ✅ Daily Return: Percentage change calculation
    - ✅ Position Values: Previous and current value tracking
    
    ### 3. fetch_and_cache_prices(db, symbols_list)
    - ✅ API Integration: Uses existing MarketDataService.fetch_current_prices()
    - ✅ Cache Updates: Updates market_data_cache table for valid prices
    - ✅ Fallback: Retrieves cached prices for failed API calls
    - ✅ Bulk Operations: Efficient batch processing for multiple symbols
    - ✅ Comprehensive Logging: Detailed success/failure tracking
    
    ## Additional Features
    
    ### Helper Functions:
    - ✅ is_options_position() - Detects options vs stock positions
    - ✅ update_position_market_values() - Single position update with database persist
    - ✅ bulk_update_position_values() - Efficient batch updates for portfolios
    - ✅ get_previous_trading_day_price() - Database query for previous prices
    
    ### Batch Processing Integration:
    - ✅ Updated daily_calculations.py with Section 1.4.1 functions
    - ✅ Portfolio Aggregations: Total market value, exposure, long/short breakdown
    - ✅ Bulk Position Updates: Processes all active positions efficiently
    - ✅ Error Resilience: Comprehensive error handling and reporting
    
    ## Testing & Validation
    
    ### Test Results:
    - ✅ Stock Long Position: Market value ,500, P&L  ✓
    - ✅ Options Long Call: Market value ,875 (5 contracts × .75 × 100) ✓
    - ✅ Stock Short Position: Negative exposure, positive P&L from price drop ✓
    - ✅ Position Type Detection: Correctly identifies options vs stocks ✓
    
    ### Key Business Logic Verified:
    1. Market Value: Always positive regardless of long/short
    2. Exposure: Signed (positive for long, negative for short)
    3. Options Multiplier: 100x for contract-to-share conversion
    4. Previous Price Logic: Database → Fallback → Error handling
    5. Portfolio Aggregations: Proper long/short/gross/net calculations
    
    ## Files Created/Updated:
    - ✅ app/calculations/market_data.py - Core calculation functions
    - ✅ app/calculations/__init__.py - Module initialization
    - ✅ tests/test_market_data_calculations.py - Comprehensive test suite
    - ✅ scripts/test_calculations.py - Manual testing and validation
    - ✅ app/batch/daily_calculations.py - Batch processing integration
    
    This implementation completes Section 1.4.1 of the Core Calculation Engine with robust database integration, comprehensive error handling, and full test coverage.
