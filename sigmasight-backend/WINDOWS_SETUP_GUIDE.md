3. **Start the database:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Start SigmaSight:**
   ```bash
   uv run python run.py
   ```

5. **Stop everything when done:**
   - Press `Ctrl + C` in Command Prompt to stop SigmaSight
   - Run `docker-compose down` to stop the database

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "python is not recognized"
- Python wasn't added to PATH during installation
- Reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add to PATH"

### "docker is not recognized"
- Docker Desktop isn't running
- Start Docker Desktop from Start Menu

### "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"
- Docker Desktop isn't fully started
- Wait for whale icon to turn green in system tray

### "uv is not recognized"
- Close and reopen Command Prompt after UV installation
- Try running in PowerShell instead

### Database connection errors
- Make sure Docker is running: `docker ps`
- Restart database: `docker-compose down` then `docker-compose up -d`

### Port 8000 already in use
- Another program is using port 8000
- Stop SigmaSight with Ctrl+C and try again
