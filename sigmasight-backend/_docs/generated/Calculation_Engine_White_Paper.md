## Understanding Portfolio Analytics

### The Big Picture

Imagine you're driving a car. You have a dashboard that shows you speed, fuel level, engine temperature, and warning lights. Similarly, a portfolio needs a dashboard showing its "vital signs":

- **How much is it worth?** (Market Value)
- **Am I making or losing money?** (P&L - Profit & Loss)
- **How risky is my portfolio?** (Risk Metrics)
- **What happens if the market crashes?** (Stress Testing)
- **Which positions move together?** (Correlations)

Our calculation engine is that dashboard, running complex calculations to answer these questions accurately and quickly.

### Why Eight Different Calculations?

Each calculation module answers a specific question about your portfolio:

1. **Market Data**: "What are my positions worth right now?"
2. **Greeks**: "How sensitive are my options to market changes?"
3. **Aggregation**: "What's my total exposure across all positions?"
4. **Factors**: "How exposed am I to different market themes (tech, value, growth)?"
5. **Correlations**: "Which positions move together?"
6. **Market Risk**: "How much could I lose on a bad day?"
7. **Stress Testing**: "What happens in a market crash?"
8. **Snapshots**: "How has my portfolio changed over time?"

### Real-World Example

Let's say you manage a $10 million portfolio with 50 positions including stocks and options. Every morning at 5:15 AM, our system:

1. Updates prices for all your holdings
2. Calculates your overnight profit/loss
3. Measures your risk exposure to market sectors
4. Checks what would happen in 15 different crisis scenarios
5. Saves a snapshot for historical tracking

By 6:00 AM, you have a complete risk report waiting in your inbox.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack

Think of our technology stack like the ingredients in a recipe:

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (the kitchen) - handles all requests and coordinates work
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (the pantry) - stores all data reliably
- **Package Manager**: UV (the shopping list) - manages all software dependencies
- **Calculation Libraries**: (the cooking tools)
  - mibian: Calculates options prices (like a specialized calculator)
  - statsmodels: Performs statistical analysis (finds patterns in data)
  - pandas/numpy: Data manipulation (organizes and processes numbers)
  - empyrical: Risk metrics (measures portfolio risk)

### Batch Processing Architecture

**What is Batch Processing?**

Instead of calculating everything continuously (which would be like keeping your oven on all day), we run calculations in scheduled "batches" - like meal prep for the week. Every morning, the system processes all portfolios sequentially, ensuring accuracy and avoiding conflicts.

```python
job_sequence = [
    ("market_data_update", ...),      # Step 1: Get latest prices
    ("portfolio_aggregation", ...),    # Step 2: Add up all positions
    ("greeks_calculation", ...),       # Step 3: Calculate options sensitivities
    ("factor_analysis", ...),          # Step 4: Measure market factor exposure
    ("market_risk_scenarios", ...),    # Step 5: Calculate risk metrics
    ("stress_testing", ...),           # Step 6: Run crisis scenarios
    ("portfolio_snapshot", ...),       # Step 7: Save daily state
    ("position_correlations", ...),    # Step 8: Find related positions
]
```

**Why Sequential Processing?**

We process portfolios one at a time (like a single-file line) rather than all at once (like a crowd rushing through a door). This prevents technical conflicts and ensures each portfolio gets accurate calculations.

## Section 1.4.1: Market Data Calculations

### Overview

This is the foundation - determining what each position is worth and whether you're making or losing money.

### What This Means for Your Business

Every investment position has three critical numbers:
1. **What you paid for it** (Cost Basis)
2. **What it's worth now** (Market Value)
3. **The difference** (Profit/Loss)

Our system calculates these for every position, every day, handling both regular stocks and complex options contracts.

### Position Valuation Engine

#### Understanding the Basics

**Market Value vs. Exposure - What's the Difference?**

- **Market Value**: The absolute amount at risk (always positive)
  - Think of it as: "How much money is tied up in this position?"
  - Example: 100 shares of Apple at $150 = $15,000 market value

- **Exposure**: The directional bet (positive for long, negative for short)
  - Think of it as: "Which direction am I betting and how much?"
  - Long 100 shares = +$15,000 exposure (betting on price going up)
  - Short 100 shares = -$15,000 exposure (betting on price going down)

#### Core Formulas

**For Non-Technical Readers:**

```
What It's Worth = Number of Shares × Current Price × Multiplier

Your Profit/Loss = What It's Worth Now - What You Paid
```

**For Quantitative Analysts:**

```
Market Value = |Quantity| × Current Price × Multiplier
Exposure = Quantity × Current Price × Multiplier
Unrealized P&L = Current Exposure - Cost Basis
where Cost Basis = Quantity × Entry Price × Multiplier
```

#### Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Buying Stock (Long Position)**

You buy 1,000 shares of Apple at $150. The price rises to $155.

- **Your Investment**: 1,000 × $150 = $150,000
- **Current Value**: 1,000 × $155 = $155,000
- **Your Profit**: $155,000 - $150,000 = $5,000 ✓

**Example 2: Betting Against a Stock (Short Position)**

You short 500 shares of Tesla at $200 (betting the price will fall). The price drops to $180.

- **Your Bet**: Sold 500 shares at $200 = $100,000 received
- **Cost to Buy Back**: 500 × $180 = $90,000
- **Your Profit**: $100,000 - $90,000 = $10,000 ✓

**Example 3: Options Contract**

You buy 10 Apple call option contracts at $2.50. The price rises to $3.75.

- **Important**: Each option contract represents 100 shares
- **Your Investment**: 10 contracts × $2.50 × 100 shares = $2,500
- **Current Value**: 10 contracts × $3.75 × 100 shares = $3,750
- **Your Profit**: $3,750 - $2,500 = $1,250 ✓

### Daily P&L Calculations

**What is Daily P&L?**

Daily P&L tells you how much money you made or lost today specifically. It's like checking your weight daily when dieting - you want to know if today helped or hurt your goal.

```
Today's Profit/Loss = Number of Shares × (Today's Price - Yesterday's Price) × Multiplier
```

### Market Data Integration

**Where Does Price Data Come From?**

- **Primary Source**: FMP (Financial Modeling Prep) - professional data for stocks/ETFs
- **Backup Source**: Polygon - specialized options data
- **Storage**: We cache prices in our database for speed and reliability
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with 5-day lookback for accuracy
- **History**: We keep 150 days of history for trend analysis

## Section 1.4.2: Options Greeks Calculations

### What Are Options Greeks? (For Everyone)

Options Greeks are like the instrument panel in an airplane - they show how your options will behave under different conditions. Each "Greek" (named after Greek letters) measures a different type of sensitivity.

### Why Greeks Matter to Your Business

If you trade options, Greeks help you understand:
- How much money you'll make if the stock moves $1 (Delta)
- How fast your profits accelerate (Gamma)
- How much value you lose each day from time decay (Theta)
- How volatility changes affect your position (Vega)
- How interest rate changes impact value (Rho)

### The Five Greeks Explained

#### 1. Delta (Δ) - "The Speed Gauge"

**What it measures**: How much your option value changes when the stock moves $1

**Business Translation**: 
- Delta of 0.5 means: If the stock goes up $1, your option goes up $0.50
- Think of it like driving: Delta is your speed - how fast you're making/losing money as the stock moves

**Real Example**: 
You own Apple calls with delta of 0.6. Apple rises $10. Your options gain $6 per share (0.6 × $10).

#### 2. Gamma (Γ) - "The Acceleration"

**What it measures**: How fast your Delta changes

**Business Translation**: 
- Like a car's acceleration - shows if you're speeding up or slowing down
- High gamma means your profits/losses can accelerate quickly

**Real Example**: 
Your option has gamma of 0.05. If the stock moves $1, your delta increases by 0.05 (getting more sensitive).

#### 3. Theta (Θ) - "The Time Tax"

**What it measures**: How much value your option loses each day

**Business Translation**: 
- Options are like insurance policies - they lose value as they approach expiration
- Theta of -0.05 means you lose $5 per day per contract (100 shares × $0.05)

**Real Example**: 
Your option expires in 30 days with theta of -0.10. You're losing $10/day just from time passing.

#### 4. Vega (ν) - "The Volatility Sensor"

**What it measures**: How much your option value changes when volatility changes by 1%

**Business Translation**: 
- When markets get scary (volatile), options become more valuable
- Like earthquake insurance - worth more when earthquakes are likely

**Real Example**: 
Market volatility spikes 5% on Fed news. Your option with vega of 0.20 gains $1.00 (5 × $0.20).

#### 5. Rho (ρ) - "The Interest Rate Effect"

**What it measures**: How much your option changes when interest rates change by 1%

**Business Translation**: 
- Usually the least important Greek
- Matters more for long-term options

### Implementation Architecture

**For Technical Readers**: We use the mibian library exclusively for Black-Scholes calculations. No mock fallbacks in production - if we can't calculate real Greeks, we flag the position for manual review.

**For Business Readers**: We use industry-standard Nobel Prize-winning formulas (Black-Scholes) to calculate these sensitivities accurately.

## Section 1.4.3: Portfolio Aggregation Engine

### What is Portfolio Aggregation?

Imagine you have 50 different investments. Aggregation is like creating a summary report that shows your total exposure, total profit/loss, and overall risk in one place.

### Core Aggregation Functions

#### Understanding Exposure Types

**Gross vs. Net Exposure - What's the Difference?**

Think of a football game:
- **Gross Exposure**: Total bets placed (regardless of which team)
- **Net Exposure**: Your actual directional bet (which team you favor overall)

**Example**:
- You bet $100,000 on Team A (long position)
- You bet $60,000 against Team B (short position)
- **Gross Exposure**: $160,000 (total money at risk)
- **Net Exposure**: $40,000 long (your net bullish position)

#### Long/Short Breakdown

**For Business Context**:
- **Long Exposure**: Investments betting on prices going UP
- **Short Exposure**: Investments betting on prices going DOWN
- **Why Both?**: Hedge funds often bet both ways to reduce risk

#### Delta-Adjusted Exposures

**What is Delta Adjustment?**

For options, we need to convert them to "stock equivalent" exposure. It's like converting different currencies to USD for comparison.

**Example**: 
- You own 10 call options with delta 0.5
- Each contract = 100 shares
- Stock equivalent = 10 × 100 × 0.5 = 500 shares equivalent

---

## Section 1.4.4: Factor Analysis System

### What is Factor Analysis? (For Everyone)

Factor analysis is like understanding what makes your car go fast. Is it the engine (market factor)? The aerodynamics (momentum)? The weight (value)? Similarly, we analyze what drives your portfolio's performance.

### The Seven Market Factors

Think of factors as different "flavors" of market risk:

| Factor | What It Represents | Real-World Example |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Market** | Overall stock market movement | "When the S&P 500 moves 1%, how much does my portfolio move?" |
| **Value** | Cheap stocks based on fundamentals | Companies trading below their book value |
| **Growth** | Fast-growing companies | Tech companies with high revenue growth |
| **Momentum** | Stocks on winning streaks | Stocks that have risen strongly recently |
| **Quality** | Profitable, stable companies | Companies with consistent earnings |
| **Size** | Smaller company premium | Small-cap vs. large-cap performance |
| **Low Volatility** | Stable, defensive stocks | Utilities and consumer staples |

### Critical Discovery: The Correlation Problem

**What We Found**: These factors are highly correlated (move together), like cars in rush hour traffic - when one slows down, they all tend to slow down.

**The Numbers**:
- Value and Size factors: 95.4% correlated (almost perfect correlation!)
- Quality factor: VIF of 39 (indicates severe overlap)
- Condition number: 645 (mathematical instability)

**What This Means for You**: 
- We can't use fancy multi-factor models (they become unstable)
- We use simpler, one-factor-at-a-time analysis (more reliable)
- Like checking each car system separately rather than all at once

### How We Measure Factor Exposure

**Beta - Your Sensitivity Score**

Beta measures how sensitive your portfolio is to each factor:
- Beta = 1.0: You move exactly with the factor
- Beta = 2.0: You move twice as much (2x leveraged)
- Beta = 0.5: You move half as much (defensive)
- Beta = -1.0: You move opposite (hedged)

**Example**: Your portfolio has a Market beta of 1.3
- When the S&P 500 rises 10%, you expect to rise 13%
- When the S&P 500 falls 10%, you expect to fall 13%

### Data Quality Issues We're Fixing

1. **Zero-filling Problem**: Like assuming your car didn't move on days you didn't check the odometer
2. **Options Without Delta**: Like measuring a convertible with the top up vs. down
3. **Hard Caps**: Like limiting your speedometer to 120mph when you might go faster
4. **Insufficient Data**: Like judging performance from just one week of driving

---

## Section 1.4.5: Position Correlations

### What Are Correlations? (For Everyone)

Correlation measures how much two investments move together. It's like noting that when it rains, umbrella sales go up and sunscreen sales go down.

### Understanding Correlation Numbers

- **+1.0**: Perfect correlation (move exactly together)
  - Example: Two S&P 500 index funds
- **0.0**: No correlation (completely independent)
  - Example: Apple stock and rainfall in Seattle
- **-1.0**: Perfect negative correlation (move exactly opposite)
  - Example: Long and short positions in the same stock

### Why Correlations Matter

**Risk Management**: If all your positions are highly correlated, they'll all lose money at the same time in a downturn. It's like putting all your eggs in one basket.

**Real Example**:
- You own Apple, Microsoft, and Google
- They're all tech stocks with 0.8+ correlation
- When tech crashes, they ALL crash together
- Better to mix in some uncorrelated assets (bonds, commodities)

### How We Calculate Correlations

We look at 60 days of price movements and calculate how synchronized they are. We only store correlations above 0.3 (meaningful relationships).

---

## Section 1.4.6: Market Risk Scenarios

### What is Market Risk?

Market risk is the chance of losing money due to market movements. It's like weather risk for outdoor events - you need to know the probability and impact of rain.

### Key Risk Metrics Explained

#### Value at Risk (VaR)

**What it means**: "What's the most I could lose on a normal bad day?"

**The Numbers**:
- 95% VaR of $100,000: On 95% of days, you won't lose more than $100,000
- 99% VaR of $200,000: On 99% of days, you won't lose more than $200,000

**Real-World Translation**: 
- 95% VaR = Your typical worst day (happens ~once a month)
- 99% VaR = Your really bad day (happens ~twice a year)

#### Volatility

**What it means**: How much your portfolio value swings around

**Business Context**:
- 10% annual volatility = calm, bond-like
- 20% annual volatility = typical stock portfolio
- 40% annual volatility = aggressive, high-risk

#### Sharpe Ratio

**What it means**: Your return per unit of risk (bang for your buck)

**The Scale**:
- Below 0: Losing money
- 0-1: Okay performance
- 1-2: Good performance
- Above 2: Excellent performance

#### Maximum Drawdown

**What it means**: The worst peak-to-valley loss in history

**Example**: Your portfolio grew from $1M to $1.5M, then fell to $1.1M
- Maximum Drawdown = -26.7% (from $1.5M to $1.1M)

---

## Section 1.4.7: Stress Testing Framework

### What is Stress Testing?

Stress testing is like crash-testing a car - we simulate various disasters to see how your portfolio would perform. Better to know in advance than be surprised!

### The 15 Scenarios We Test

#### Market Shocks (5 scenarios)
1. **Equity Crash**: What if stocks fall 20%? (Like March 2020)
2. **Tech Bubble Burst**: What if tech falls 30%? (Like 2000)
3. **Flight to Quality**: Investors flee to safety
4. **Sector Rotation**: Money moves from growth to value
5. **Liquidity Crisis**: Hard to sell positions

#### Interest Rate Scenarios (3 scenarios)
1. **Fed Tightening**: Rates rise 2% (inflation fighting)
2. **Yield Curve Inversion**: Short rates exceed long rates (recession signal)
3. **Zero Bound**: Rates go to zero (crisis response)

#### Volatility Events (3 scenarios)
1. **VIX Spike**: Fear gauge jumps 50%
2. **Flash Crash**: 10% drop in minutes
3. **Volatility Crush**: Options lose value fast

#### Geopolitical Events (2 scenarios)
1. **Oil Shock**: Energy prices spike 50%
2. **Trade War**: International trade disrupted

#### Black Swan Events (2 scenarios)
1. **Pandemic 2.0**: Global shutdown scenario
2. **Systemic Crisis**: Banking system stress

### How Correlation Makes Things Worse

When one factor crashes, correlated factors often follow. It's like dominoes - push one, others fall.

**Example**: In a market crash:
- Stocks fall 20% (direct impact)
- High-correlation factors fall 15% (sympathetic impact)
- Your total loss might be 30%+ (combined impact)

### The 99% Loss Cap

We cap losses at 99% of portfolio value. Why? Because in reality, exchanges would halt trading, margins would be called, and positions would be closed before 100% loss.

---

## Section 1.4.8: Portfolio Snapshots

### What Are Snapshots?

Daily snapshots are like taking a photograph of your portfolio every day. Over time, these create a "movie" showing how your portfolio evolved.

### What We Capture Daily

Think of it as your portfolio's daily report card:
- Total Value (what it's worth)
- Total P&L (profit/loss)
- Exposure Breakdown (long vs. short)
- Position Count (number of holdings)
- Risk Metrics (VaR, Sharpe ratio)
- Market Beta (market sensitivity)

### Why Historical Snapshots Matter

1. **Performance Tracking**: See your journey over time
2. **Risk Evolution**: Understand how your risk changed
3. **Audit Trail**: Prove what you owned when
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify what works

---

## Batch Processing Framework

### What is Batch Processing?

Instead of calculating continuously (expensive and complex), we process everything once per day in a "batch" - like doing all your laundry on Sunday instead of one sock at a time.

### The Daily Schedule

**5:15 AM**: System wakes up
**5:20 AM**: Fetches latest market prices
**5:30 AM**: Processes Portfolio #1
**5:45 AM**: Processes Portfolio #2
**6:00 AM**: Processes Portfolio #3
**6:15 AM**: Generates reports
**6:30 AM**: Emails sent to users

### Why Sequential Processing?

We process one portfolio at a time to avoid conflicts. It's like having one chef in the kitchen instead of three - less chance of mistakes.

### Error Handling Philosophy

**Smart Retries**: If something fails, we try twice more with delays
**Categorized Errors**: 
- Temporary (network issues) → Retry
- Permanent (bad data) → Skip and alert
**Graceful Degradation**: If one portfolio fails, others still process

### Performance Metrics

- **Speed**: 30-45 seconds per portfolio
- **Reliability**: 100% success rate in latest runs
- **Freshness**: 0-day lag (real-time prices)

---
