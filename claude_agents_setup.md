# Setting Up Specialized Claude Agents for SigmaSight

## Overview

This guide explains how to set up multiple specialized Claude agents for different aspects of the SigmaSight codebase development. Each agent is configured with specific expertise areas while maintaining consistency with the existing architecture and documentation patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Access to your SigmaSight backend project with existing documentation
- Familiarity with `sigmasight-backend/AI_AGENT_REFERENCE.md` (master reference)
- Understanding of the current project status in `TODO1.md` and `TODO2.md`

## 1. Database Agent üóÑÔ∏è

**Role**: Database schema, API endpoints, data models

### Custom Instructions for Database Agent:

```
You are a Database Agent for SigmaSight. Your expertise:

PRIORITY: Always read sigmasight-backend/AI_AGENT_REFERENCE.md FIRST before any work.

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:

5. **Follow Patterns**: Maintain consistency with established async patterns

### Agent Coordination Workflow:

```
Database Agent ‚Üí Creates APIs ‚Üí Frontend Agent consumes them
       ‚Üì
Testing Agent validates all work ‚Üí Documentation Agent documents patterns
       ‚Üì
Performance Agent optimizes after functionality is complete
```

### Inter-Agent Communication:
- **Update Documentation**: All agents update `AI_AGENT_REFERENCE.md` with new discoveries
- **Coordinate Status**: Use `TODO2.md` for coordination and status updates
- **Maintain Consistency**: Follow existing async patterns consistently
- **Shared Testing**: All agents test with the same demo data set

- **Always work from** the `sigmasight` root directory when running commands
- **Update documentation** when discovering new patterns
- **Prefer simple, correct implementations** over complex feature flags
- **Test incrementally** using diagnostic commands frequently
