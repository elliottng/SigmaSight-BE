# ü§ñ Cascade AI Prompts for SigmaSight Backend

Copy and paste these prompts into Cascade to get started quickly with the SigmaSight backend project.

## üöÄ Initial Setup Prompt

```
I just cloned the SigmaSight Backend repository and opened it in Windsurf. This is a FastAPI portfolio risk management backend project. 

Please help me:
1. Set up the development environment (install UV package manager if needed)
2. Install all dependencies using UV
3. Configure the environment file
4. Start the development server
5. Run the verification script to ensure everything is working

The project uses Python 3.11+, FastAPI, UV package manager, and has setup scripts available. There should be a comprehensive README.md and verification script in the scripts/ folder.
```
