# Polygon API Analysis - Options Data Access

## Current Situation

### Subscription
- **Current Plan**: Starter ($29/month)
- **API Key**: Configured and working
- **Problem**: No pricing data access for stocks OR options

### What's Working ✅
1. **Options Contract Metadata**
   - `list_options_contracts()` returns full options chain
   - Successfully retrieved 2,322 AAPL contracts
   - Includes: strike prices, expiration dates, contract types
   - Correct OCC symbol format: `O:AAPL250808C00110000`

2. **Correct Endpoint Usage**
   - `/v3/reference/options/contracts` - Working correctly
   - Proper parameters: underlying_ticker, limit

### What's NOT Working ❌
1. **Price Data** (Critical for our system)
   - `get_last_trade()` returns "NOT_AUTHORIZED" 
   - Affects both stocks AND options
   - No access to current prices or historical OHLC data

2. **Affected Features**
   - Market value calculations (need current prices)
   - Greeks calculations (need underlying stock prices)
   - P&L calculations (need price history)
   - Factor analysis (need 150 days of prices, previously 252d)

## Root Cause

The Polygon Starter plan ($29) includes:
- ✅ Reference data (tickers, contracts, metadata)
- ✅ 15-minute delayed snapshots
- ❌ NO trades endpoint
- ❌ NO quotes endpoint
- ❌ NO last trade prices

## Options for Resolution

### Option 1: Upgrade Polygon Plan
**Developer Plan ($79/month)**
- ✅ Includes trades endpoint
- ✅ 10 years historical data
- ❌ Still 15-minute delayed
- ⚠️ May still not include options trades

**Advanced Plan ($199/month)**
- ✅ Real-time data
- ✅ Quotes endpoint
- ✅ Trades endpoint
- ⚠️ Need to verify options coverage

### Option 2: Use Alternative Data Sources
Since we already have FMP for stocks:
1. **Use FMP for all stock/ETF prices** (already implemented)
2. **Find alternative options pricing source**:
   - Yahoo Finance (free but unreliable)
   - TradingView (requires different integration)
   - CBOE direct (expensive)
   - Interactive Brokers API (requires account)

### Option 3: Work with Current Limitations
1. **Use Polygon for options metadata only** (strikes, expirations)
2. **Use FMP for underlying stock prices**
3. **Implement mock options prices** for demo:
   - Calculate theoretical prices using Black-Scholes
   - Use implied volatility estimates
   - Good enough for demo purposes

## Recommendation

For immediate demo needs:
1. **Continue using Polygon Starter** for options contract metadata
2. **Use FMP for all stock/ETF pricing** (already working)
3. **Implement theoretical options pricing** using Black-Scholes:
   - We have strikes and expirations from Polygon
   - We have underlying prices from FMP
   - Calculate theoretical prices for Greeks and valuations

For production:
1. **Verify with Polygon support** exact options coverage per tier
2. **Consider Advanced plan** if real-time options needed
3. **Evaluate alternatives** like Interactive Brokers API

## Implementation Notes

### Current Code Adjustments Needed:
1. Stop calling `get_last_trade()` for options
2. Use FMP for underlying prices (already done)
3. Add theoretical pricing for options positions
4. Document that options values are theoretical in demo

### Files Affected:
- `app/services/market_data_service.py` - Remove options price fetching
- `app/calculations/greeks.py` - Already uses market data correctly
- `app/calculations/market_data.py` - May need mock options prices

Questions to ask:
1. Which plan includes options trades/quotes data?
2. Is options pricing available on Developer plan?
3. Cost for real-time options data access?
4. Any academic or startup discounts available?
