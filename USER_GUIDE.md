2. **Ask follow-up questions** to drill deeper
3. **Request explanations** of complex concepts
4. **Use natural language** - no special syntax needed

**Example Conversation Flow**:
```
User: "What are my biggest risks?"

AI: "I've identified three primary risks in your portfolio:

1. **Sector Concentration**: 35% exposure to technology sector
   - Above typical 25% diversification threshold
   - Creates vulnerability to tech-specific events

2. **Options Gamma Risk**: High gamma exposure expiring Friday
   - 850 delta equivalent in expiring options
   - Could cause significant position changes

3. **Market Beta**: Portfolio beta of 1.25
   - Higher volatility than broad market
   - Amplifies both gains and losses

Recommendations:
- Reduce tech allocation to <30%
- Consider rolling expiring options
- Add defensive positions to lower beta"

User: "How should I reduce tech exposure?"

AI: "Here are three strategies to reduce your tech concentration:

1. **Trim Largest Positions**: 
   - Reduce AAPL by 25% (from $50k to $37.5k)
   - Trim MSFT by 20% (from $40k to $32k)
   - This alone reduces tech exposure by 8%

2. **Add Non-Tech Positions**:
   - Consider healthcare (XLV) or utilities (XLU)
   - Target 5-10% allocation each
   - Provides defensive characteristics

3. **Sector Rotation ETFs**:
   - Use XLK (tech) to XLF (financial) pair trade
   - Maintains market exposure while reducing sector risk
   - Can implement gradually over 2-3 weeks

Would you like specific position sizes for any of these strategies?"

### Factor Exposure Analysis

SigmaSight uses a comprehensive 7-factor model:

#### Core Factors

**1. Market Beta**
- Measures sensitivity to overall market movements
- Beta > 1: More volatile than market
- Beta < 1: Less volatile than market

**2. Value Factor**
- Exposure to undervalued stocks
- High value: Preference for low P/E, P/B ratios
- Low value: Growth-oriented positions

**3. Growth Factor** 
- Exposure to high-growth companies
- High growth: Companies with strong earnings growth
- Low growth: Mature, stable companies

**4. Momentum Factor**
- Exposure to recently outperforming stocks
- High momentum: Stocks with strong recent returns
- Low momentum: Recently underperforming stocks

**5. Quality Factor**
- Exposure to financially strong companies
- High quality: Strong balance sheets, stable earnings
- Low quality: Higher financial risk

**6. Size Factor**
- Exposure to small vs large cap stocks
- Positive: Small cap tilt
- Negative: Large cap tilt

**7. Low Volatility Factor**
- Exposure to low-volatility stocks
- High exposure: Preference for stable stocks
- Low exposure: Acceptance of higher volatility

#### Reading Factor Exposures

**Factor Exposure Scale**:
- **+1.0**: Very high positive exposure
- **+0.5**: Moderate positive exposure
- **0.0**: Neutral exposure
- **-0.5**: Moderate negative exposure
- **-1.0**: Very high negative exposure

**Example Interpretation**:
```
Market Beta: 1.15    (15% more volatile than market)
Value: -0.25         (Slight growth tilt)
Growth: 0.45         (Moderate growth exposure)
Momentum: 0.10       (Slight momentum tilt)
Quality: 0.30        (Preference for quality companies)
Size: -0.15          (Slight large-cap tilt)
Low Vol: -0.20       (Accepting higher volatility)
```

## Risk Management

### Value at Risk (VaR) Analysis

**What is VaR?**
Value at Risk estimates the maximum potential loss over a specific time period at a given confidence level.

**VaR Metrics in SigmaSight**:
- **1-Day VaR (99%)**: Maximum expected loss in 1 day, 99% confidence
- **1-Week VaR (95%)**: Maximum expected loss in 1 week, 95% confidence
- **1-Month VaR (95%)**: Maximum expected loss in 1 month, 95% confidence

**Reading VaR Numbers**:
- **VaR of -$10,000 (99%, 1-day)**: In 99% of cases, daily losses won't exceed $10,000
- **Only 1% chance** of losing more than the VaR amount
- **Not a maximum possible loss** - just a statistical confidence level

### Expected Shortfall (ES)

**What is Expected Shortfall?**
ES estimates the average loss when losses exceed the VaR threshold.

**Why ES Matters**:
- **Tail Risk Measure**: Shows severity of worst-case scenarios
- **Beyond VaR**: Captures losses in the worst 1% of cases
- **Risk Budgeting**: Helps size positions for extreme events

**Example**:
```
VaR (99%, 1-day): -$15,000
ES (99%, 1-day): -$22,000

Interpretation:
- 99% of days, losses stay below $15,000
- In the worst 1% of days, average loss is $22,000
- Helps understand tail risk exposure
```

### Stress Testing

**Predefined Scenarios**:
- **Market Crash**: -20% equity market decline
- **Rate Shock**: +200 basis point rate increase
- **Credit Crisis**: Credit spread widening
- **Volatility Spike**: VIX increase to 40+
- **Currency Crisis**: Major currency movements

**Custom Scenarios**:
- **Sector Rotation**: Specific sector declines
- **Stock-Specific Events**: Individual position shocks
- **Correlation Breakdown**: Diversification failure
- **Liquidity Crisis**: Bid-ask spread widening

**Interpreting Stress Tests**:
- **Scenario P&L**: Expected gain/loss in each scenario
- **Worst Case**: Most severe potential outcome
- **Best Case**: Most favorable potential outcome
- **Probability Weighted**: Expected outcome across all scenarios

### Options Risk Management

**Greeks Overview**:

**Delta**
- **Measures**: Price sensitivity to underlying stock movement
- **Portfolio Delta**: Net exposure to underlying price moves
- **Management**: High delta = high directional risk

**Gamma**  
- **Measures**: Rate of change of delta
- **Portfolio Gamma**: Acceleration of P&L changes
- **Management**: High gamma = position changes rapidly

**Theta**
- **Measures**: Time decay of option values
- **Portfolio Theta**: Daily time decay P&L
- **Management**: Negative theta = losing money over time

**Vega**
- **Measures**: Sensitivity to implied volatility changes
- **Portfolio Vega**: Exposure to volatility risk
- **Management**: High vega = volatility sensitive

**Example Greeks Analysis**:
```
Portfolio Greeks Summary:
Delta: +$125,000    (Bullish directional exposure)
Gamma: -$8,500      (Short gamma = short acceleration)
Theta: -$450/day    (Losing $450 daily to time decay)
Vega: +$12,000      (Long volatility exposure)

Risk Assessment:
- Strong bullish bias (high positive delta)
- Short gamma creates risk in volatile markets
- Time decay working against the portfolio
- Benefits from volatility increases
```

### Risk Limits and Alerts

**Automatic Alerts**:
- **Concentration Risk**: Single position >10% of portfolio
- **Sector Risk**: Sector allocation >25% of portfolio
